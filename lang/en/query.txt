Queries can be about pages, IP addresses, or Countries. 
 Page queries have priorty over IP queries and both have priority over country queries, so that while you can
enter both an IP address and a page name, the result returned will refer to the page query.  If you query either a page or an IP address and also select a country,
data will be returned only for IP addresses which match the country.  The page search function is case-insensitive and will match partial names
aw well as whole names.  So, for instance, if you search for ''wiki'', it will return all pages which occur in the wiki namespace and any other pages
which include wiki in their names.


When you query a page or an IP address you will get a table with the following columns for each of the months you select from the drop-down menu of months:

|''Month''|''Accesses''|''Pages''|''Country''|''User Agent''|''Search Terms''|''Name Spaces''|''Query String Names''|''Query String Values''|

When you query a page, this data will be displayed for every IP address that has accessed the page.  This can sometimes amount to a considerable amount of output,
especailly for IP addresses that are spiders and have accessed many pages on your wiki.  Therefore, when you query a page, you have the option
of displaying a ''brief'' format with the following columns:

|''Month''|''Accesses''|''Country''|''User Agent''|

In the case of country queries, the columns will be the same as in the long form above, but with the exclusion of the ''country'' column.  

There is a drop -down menu of files which are currently using the quickstats syntax.  You can click on theese an the page will pop up.  The purpose
here is to give you a convenient means of checking page names and IP's which you might want to use in  your queries.

**Notes**  \\
1. The User Agent will be a browser or the name of a spider, search engine robot, or crawler. \\
2. The ''Accesses'' column always refers to the number of times the IP address has accessed pages on your wiki.  When you request data about a page or 
group of pages, the header for each page will indicate the number of times the page itself has been accessed.  The header for page output will
look like this and will then be followed by the listings of IP addresses which have accesed that page:

======wiki:syntax======
===Total accesses for wiki:syntax: 53===
