Quickstats will give you the web traffic for modest sites.  It is not yet optimized for high volume traffic.
Its advantage for many users is that is does not require an sql database.  

Quickstats uses the following modules:

from Maxmind: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
geoipcity.inc
GeoLiteCity.dat

GeoLiteCity.dat must be downloaded from Maxmind and stored in /usr/local/share/GeoIP/
It is available as a tgz file:
   http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
Unpack the file and place it in /usr/local/share/GeoIP.
For further installation instructions see http://www.maxmind.com/app/installation?city=1 
  
Unfortunately for the present this restricts quickstats to *nix systems.  This short-coming
will be remedied as the plugin develops.  However,If you are prepared to make a small programming change,
for Windows, you can enter the path to GeoLiteCity.dat in the function get_country() of action.php,
where you will find the following lines:
    $giCity = geoip_open("/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat",GEOIP_STANDARD);
    //$giCity = geoip_open(QUICK_STATS. 'GEOIP/GeoLiteCity.dat',GEOIP_STANDARD);
A simple way solution is to place GeoLiteCity.dat in quickstat/GEOIP, then comment out
the first line and uncomment the second:
    //$giCity = geoip_open("/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat",GEOIP_STANDARD);
    $giCity = geoip_open(QUICK_STATS. 'GEOIP/GeoLiteCity.dat',GEOIP_STANDARD);    




---------------------------------------
Quickstats outputs its statistics to a Dokuwiki page using the following syntaxes:

Syntax:
Stats for current month
~~QUICKSTATS:~~    
~~QUICKSTATS:ip~~
~~QUICKSTATS:misc~~
~~QUICKSTATS:countries~~
~~QUICKSTATS:pages~~

Stats for a previous month
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&ip~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&misc~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&countries~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&pages~~

The months are numbered from 1 to 12
1_2012 = January 2012
12_2011 = December 2011

~~QUICKSTATS:~~ is a snynonym for ~~QUICKSTATS:basics~~   
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>~~ is a synonym for ~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&basics~~
    Example: 
     ~~QUICKSTATS:1_2011~~
     outputs 'basics' for January 2011

Output for diffferent paramaters
basics:
  Operating systems
  Browsers
  Countries
misc:
  Operating systems
  Browsers
countries:
  Countries
ip:
 IP addresses
      
Configuration Settings
    There are two settings
      1. excludes:  excludes IP addresses from stats, for instance if you don't want your own accesses to
                    your site counted in the stats
      2. aborts:    prevents IPs from accessing the site (for nuisance and spam accesses).
