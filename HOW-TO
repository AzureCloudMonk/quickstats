Quickstats will give you the web traffic for modest sites.  It is not yet optimized for high volume traffic.
Its advantage for many users is that is does not require an sql database.  

Quickstats uses the following modules:

from Maxmind: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
geoipcity.inc
GeoLiteCity.dat

GeoLiteCity.dat must be downloaded from Maxmind and stored in /usr/local/share/GeoIP/
It is available as a tgz file:

   http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

Unpack this file and place it in either in /usr/local/share/GeoIP  or quickstats/GEOIP.
The default directory for GeoLiteCity.dat is /usr/local/share/GeoIP which you will
find assigned in the Configuration Manager in the 'geop_dir' setting.  If you place it
in quickstats/GEOIP, then you must check off the checkbox for 'geoip_local'.

You do not have to put GeoLiteCity.dat in either of the two directories mentioned above.
You can install it anywhere you choose; just replace the default path in 'geoip_dir' with
the new one and make sure that 'geoip_local' is unchecked.

For additional installation instructions see http://www.maxmind.com/app/installation?city=1.



---------------------------------------
Quickstats outputs its statistics to a Dokuwiki page using the following syntaxes:

Syntax:
Stats for current month
~~QUICKSTATS:~~    
~~QUICKSTATS:ip~~
~~QUICKSTATS:misc~~
~~QUICKSTATS:countries~~
~~QUICKSTATS:pages~~

Stats for a previous month
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&ip~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&misc~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&countries~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&pages~~

The months are numbered from 1 to 12
1_2012 = January 2012
12_2011 = December 2011

~~QUICKSTATS:~~ is a snynonym for ~~QUICKSTATS:basics~~   
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>~~ is a synonym for ~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&basics~~
    Example: 
     ~~QUICKSTATS:1_2011~~
     outputs 'basics' for January 2011

Output for diffferent paramaters

Configuration Settings
    There are two settings
      1. excludes:  excludes IP addresses from stats, for instance if you don't want your own accesses to
                    your site counted in the stats
      2. aborts:    prevents IPs from accessing the site (for nuisance and spam accesses).
