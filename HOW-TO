Quickstats will give you the web traffic for modest sites.  It is not yet optimized for high volume traffic.
Its advantage for many users is that is does not require an sql database.  

Quickstats uses the following modules:

from Maxmind: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
geoipcity.inc
GeoLiteCity.dat

from http://www.geoplugin.com/
geoPlugin

Quickstats uses either geoPlugin or GeoLiteCity.dat to identify the location of IP addresses.
geoPlugin is a free web-based service, while Maxmind's GeoLiteCity.dat installs on your
server.  Quickstats defaults to geoPlugin, which means that quickstats is ready to use
upon installation into the Dokuwiki plugins directory.  GeoLiteCity must be installed
in a directory on your server.

There are benefits and downsides to both.  With GeoLiteCity, quickstats always
has instant and secure access the the location data which it needs.
However, it is recommended that you re-install updated copies
every 6 weeks, in order to keep current with changing IP data.  On Linux servers
this is simple enough to do with a cron job.  geoPlugin, on the other hand, is
always current and does not have to be installed on your server. Its data is retrieved
via an http access.  Responses from geoplugin.com tend to be fast, but there is always
the question of delay and processing time.

--------------------------------------------------
GELITECITY

GeoLiteCity.dat must be downloaded from Maxmind and stored in /usr/local/share/GeoIP/
It is available as a tgz file:

   http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

Unpack this file and place it in either in /usr/local/share/GeoIP  or quickstats/GEOIP.
The default directory for GeoLiteCity.dat is /usr/local/share/GeoIP which you will
find assigned in the Configuration Manager in the 'geop_dir' setting.  If you place it
in quickstats/GEOIP, then you must check off the checkbox for 'geoip_local'.

You do not have to put GeoLiteCity.dat in either of the two directories mentioned above.
You can install it anywhere you choose; just replace the default path in 'geoip_dir' with
the new one and make sure that 'geoip_local' is unchecked.

---------------------------------------
Quickstats outputs its statistics to a Dokuwiki page using the following syntaxes:

Syntax:
Stats for current month
~~QUICKSTATS:~~    
~~QUICKSTATS:ip~~
~~QUICKSTATS:misc~~
~~QUICKSTATS:countries~~
~~QUICKSTATS:pages~~

Stats for a previous month
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&ip~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&misc~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&countries~~
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&pages~~

The months are numbered from 1 to 12
1_2012 = January 2012
12_2011 = December 2011

~~QUICKSTATS:~~ is a snynonym for ~~QUICKSTATS:basics~~   
~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>~~ is a synonym for ~~QUICKSTATS:<month_year>&basics~~
    Example: 
     ~~QUICKSTATS:1_2011~~
     outputs 'basics' for January 2011

Output for diffferent paramaters
basics:
  Operating systems
  Browsers
  Countries
misc:
  Operating systems
  Browsers
countries:
  Countries
ip:
 IP addresses
      
Configuration Settings
    There are two settings
      1. excludes:  excludes IP addresses from stats, for instance if you don't want your own accesses to
                    your site counted in the stats
      2. aborts:    prevents IPs from accessing the site (for nuisance and spam accesses).
